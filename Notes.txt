Create the new console application:

dotnet new console DotNetStockDemo

Add the following NuGet dependencies:

dotnet add package Hazelcast.Net
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
dotnet add package Confluent.Kafka

Create a docker-compose.yml file containing:

version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 192.168.1.89
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "simpletalk_topic:1:1"
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

Make sure to update the KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME to be your public Docker host name.

Start Kafka with:

docker-compose up -d

You can see it running (both Kafka and Zookeeper) with:

docker ps

Stop Kafka with:

docker-compose stop

Start Hazelcast with:

docker run -it --rm -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=dotnet-stock-demo -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1.2

BUT actually, add this to docker-compose.yml:

  hazelcast:
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1.2
    ports:
      - 5701:5701
    environment:
      HZ_CLUSTERNAME: "dotnet-stock-demo"

And have everything run on docker-compose!
docker ps
docker logs <id>

maybe we need this:

services:
  whatever:
    image: ...
    networks:
    - hazelcast-network
networks:
  default:
    name: hazelcast-network
    external: true

-- Kafka on OSX --

Just does not work the same as on Linux and ?!

This page explains how listeners work and help understand it all -> docker-compose.yml
https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/

These pages also answer the question
https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/issues/265
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64805874/problem-with-advertised-listener-on-macos
https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/master/kafka-ecosystem/docker-compose.yml#L1-L45

BUT loading the Kafka native library fails, too
https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/issues/1755
https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/issues/1769

Supposedly they'll fix it but even with 1.9.2-RC2 we still see the issue

-- Appendix --

Make want to create a hazelcast-network Docker network?

Start Kafka?
docker run --name kafka --network hazelcast-network --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-quickstart-kafka

Start Hazelcast?
docker run -it --network hazelcast-network --rm -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=dotnetstockdemo -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1.2

Run SQL cli:
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1.2 hz-cli --targets username@172.18.0.2 sql
